<p><strong>Updated: January 24, 2026 (Version 2.0)</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you about how <strong>Bridgit Social</strong> uses your personal data. We recommend that you read it carefully.</p>

<h2 id="key-definitions"><strong>Key Definitions</strong></h2>
<p>For the purposes of this document, the following terms shall be defined as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Application</strong>: Refers to the mobile application known as <em>Bridgit Social</em>, available for download on the Apple App Store.</p>
<p><strong>Bridgit Group LLC</strong>: The legal entity under which Bridgit Social operates, incorporated in the State of New Jersey, United States.</p>
<p><strong>Bridgit</strong>: Also referred to as &quot;Bridge It!&quot;, the term describes the purpose of the platform as a digital bridge facilitating spontaneous, goal-driven connections between Users, and bridging the gap between online engagement and in-person interaction.</p>
<p><strong>Terms (TOU)</strong>: Refers to these Terms of Use governing the use of the Application and related Services.</p>
<p><strong>User</strong>: Any individual who has registered for an Account and utilizes any features or Services offered through the Application.</p>
<p><strong>User Details</strong>: Information voluntarily provided by a User, including but not limited to interests, professional background, networking intentions, and preferences. Certain details, such as age and residential area, may be optionally concealed at the User's discretion.</p>
<p><strong>Networking Intentions</strong>: User-selected goals across four categories: Professional Networking, Dating, Socializing, and Seeking Solutions. These intentions help connect users with like-minded individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Geographical Position</strong>: The User's location, which is recorded and regularly updated when the geolocation feature is enabled. A User's geographical position is not shared with other Users unless the &quot;Start Networking&quot; feature is activated.</p>
<p><strong>Start Networking</strong>: The initiation of a User's networking experience within the Application. Upon activation, the User becomes visible to and can engage with other Users based on their availability and visibility settings, as defined during registration or as updated by the User.</p>
<p><strong>Same Place Option</strong>: A feature that designates when two Users are located in the exact same physical place. This is recorded if the User enables geolocation and selects the specific place within the Application.</p>
<p><strong>Proximity/Search Within Walking Distance Option</strong>: A feature that identifies Users who are geographically close to one another—within walking distance—but not necessarily located at the exact same place.</p>
<p><strong>Walking Distance</strong>: Defined as the maximum distance between two Users such that an in-person meeting can occur within approximately 10 minutes of walking. This distance is calculated as up to one mile in both densely populated and less dense areas.</p>
<p><strong>Map</strong>: A feature that displays other Users located within the same physical area or within walking distance, once the &quot;Start Networking&quot; feature is enabled. The Map also presents general anonymized statistics regarding nearby Users.</p>
<p><strong>Mark to Meet</strong>: An action taken by a User to express interest in meeting another User. An optional note may be attached, specifying the meeting's purpose, proposed location, or any initial message.</p>
<p><strong>Connection</strong>: An interaction that results from mutual interest between two Users, allowing them to communicate within the Application.</p>
<p><strong>Feed</strong>: A feature allowing Users to share pitches and discover what others are looking for in their area. Feed posts are public and include approximate location for distance-based filtering.</p>
<p><strong>AI Pitch Assistant</strong>: An AI-powered feature that helps Users create personalized networking pitches through conversational interaction.</p>
<p><strong>My Growth</strong>: A section featuring referral programs, daily insights, event recommendations, and networking challenges to help Users grow their network.</p>
<p><strong>Referral Program</strong>: A rewards program allowing Users to earn Premium subscription time by inviting friends to join Bridgit Social.</p>
<p><strong>Services</strong>: The collective suite of features and functionalities—both complimentary and paid—offered by Bridgit Social to facilitate in-person, real-time personal and professional connections.</p>
<p><strong>Premium Membership</strong>: A subscription-based service granting Users access to advanced features and enhanced functionality within the Application.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Membership</strong>: The free tier of service providing core networking features with certain limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Account</strong>: A registered User's individual profile granting access to the Application and its Services. Each User is permitted to maintain only one active Account at any given time.</p>
