# Article 1: The Lifecycle of Relationships in Immigration: From Survival to Meaningful Connection

## My Random Thoughts
Our need for relationships in immigration and we’re struggling about it and usually a source of distress, frustration, anger, anxiety and etc.

But mostly we encounter relationships in its own lifecycle:
start with survival mode, very low in trust, usually with superficial respect, and low in honesty. This requires strong emotional intelligence and social skills - system one of brain
Either Stays in the first mode for too much long and gets boring eventually for one side or both
At this stage it either stops for 3 reasons: proximity, timing and energy
Or goes above and beyond and gets fun when things get to more meaningful deep connection: helps and contributes to both sides growth and happiness -> but getting to this stage, requires problem solving skills, not necessarily good social skills: system 2 of brain

We have a tendency to resolve our problems in two general ways, matching with two brain systems:
fast: less energy, automatic emotions, stimulus, fight and flight survival, comfort zone… less growth and more mechanical,
Slow: takes much more energy, slow process, logical, discomfort and challenge but more involved with growth

Now, in relationships cycle
Cycle of thoughts or stimuli, emotions, and behaviors
if our decisions are based on the system 1, things become quick and superficial
But real connections are when all parties involved break this vicious cycle to encourage and implement system 2 of thinking that is based on trust, respect and honesty—> hard and requires both sides work on themselves and in their skills consciously

Relationships often hold immense importance for immigrants, yet they can also be a source of frustration, distress, and anxiety. This tension stems from the complex dynamics of forming meaningful connections in unfamiliar settings. In the context of immigration, relationships often begin in “survival mode”—a stage marked by low trust, superficial respect, and minimal honesty. Navigating this phase requires emotional intelligence and social skills, engaging the brain’s System 1—fast, instinctive, and automatic processes.

However, relationships that remain in this stage too long often stagnate, leading to boredom or disconnection. When this happens, relationships typically falter for three key reasons: lack of proximity, poor timing, or depleted energy. But for those that break free from this cycle, the potential for something far greater emerges: a deep, meaningful connection that fosters growth and happiness for both parties.

### The Two Systems of the Brain in Relationships

Human brains are wired with two general problem-solving systems, and both play a crucial role in relationships:
**1. System 1:** Fast, energy-efficient, driven by emotions and survival instincts. This mode is comfortable but often mechanical, leading to superficial connections.
**2. System 2:** Slow, deliberate, and energy-intensive. This mode involves logic, discomfort, and growth, requiring individuals to consciously address challenges and invest effort into the relationship.

When relationships rely heavily on System 1, they often remain shallow, cycling through patterns of reactive emotions and automatic behaviors. This “vicious cycle” prioritizes comfort and efficiency over depth and trust. On the other hand, relationships that transcend this cycle require the effort of System 2 thinking—characterized by trust, respect, and honesty.

### Breaking the Cycle

Real, meaningful connections demand a conscious commitment from all parties to step beyond instinctive patterns. This involves challenging one’s comfort zone, fostering open communication, and being willing to grow together. These deeper relationships are not simply built on strong social skills but also on problem-solving abilities, mutual understanding, and the willingness to work through challenges collaboratively.

For immigrants, the stakes are often higher—relationships provide emotional anchors in an unfamiliar world. Yet, it is through the slow, deliberate process of nurturing trust and understanding that these connections evolve from survival mechanisms into transformative partnerships.

In the end, the transition from superficial to meaningful relationships mirrors the broader immigrant journey: a path from survival to growth, shaped by courage, effort, and the willingness to embrace discomfort for the sake of deeper, lasting fulfillment.
